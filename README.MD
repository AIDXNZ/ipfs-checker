# Description 
If you are looking to simply check if a node is available publicly use Max Indens Libp2p-lookup [here](https://github.com/mxinden/libp2p-lookup) :) 

This is for personal use as I test Bootstrapping and dialing nodes. It requires a list of Multiaddrs to dial. The main usage for the time being is for testing and pruning of the peerlist.
